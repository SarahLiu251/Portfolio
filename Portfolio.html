                    Hi there! I'm Sarah, an Mechanical Engineering student at <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu" target="_blank">The City College of New York</a>.
                    Through my own academic career after taking classes such as Thermal System designs and 
                    Fluid mechanics, I develop an interest in sustainable design in the field of energy and 
                    water resources. From developing an hydroponic garden systems as a means of promoting 
                    locally grown produce to exploring the world of data visualizations to help develop an 
                    Urban Heat Island index in the battle aganist climate change, I'm passionate about learning 
                    new tools to solve real-world issues. In my free time, I also enjoy learning new skills such as 
                    coding, animation and doing art n craft! Thank you for taking the time to read a little about me :) </p>

                        a means of joint support to achieve reduction of stress concentration at sharp edges. 
                        Considerations will also be made to lower the cost (by use of lighter and cheaper materials),

                        <strong>Abstract: </strong>
                        Heat exchangers are critical components for applications involved with the transfer of thermal
                         energy between two or more fluids without direct contact. Managing heat exchanger’s efficiency 
                         improves energy efficiency, maintaining temperature control, and enabling processes like heating, 
                         cooling, or waste heat recovery. Among the various types of heat exchangers, the shell and tube configuration.
                          This type of heat exchanger consists of a large pressure vessel (the shell) containing tube passes [5]. 
                          One fluid flow through the tubes while the other fluid flows around the tubes. The performance of shell and 
                          tube heat exchangers can be enhanced through changes to surface area of heat transfer, achieved by adjusting 
                          tube length, diameter, or the number of tubes. Various methods of enhancing turbulence within the fluid and ensuring 
                          ease of flow in the heat exchanger can improve fluid flow and thus the heat exchange rates. Proper material selection 
                          for the shell and tubes also ensures durability and compatibility with the fluids to avoid corrosion and withstanding 
                          temperature limits. Shell and tube heat exchangers find use in power generation, as used in condensers and boilers, 
                          in the chemical sectors, they support processes such as distillation and chemical reactions and in HVAC systems, they are used for temperature control [6].

                        In this gearbox design project, the speed and torque output of the CH440 Engine must be
                        reduced and increased by a total of 12:1, respectively. Through this project, the design of the
                        transfer box casing will be designed to meet such constraints. It will house an input shaft and 2
                        output shafts connected through a universal joint. Choices will be made in the types of gears that
                        will be used, the dimensions of the shafts, the needed bearings, and the materials, all the parts
                        considered in the design.
                        The engine will first be passed through a CVT, leaving a total of 4:1 speed reduction and torque
                        increase by the transfer case. Given an initial input shaft diameter of one inch, verification of
                        changing diameters will be made through stress and deflection analysis and force analysis of the
                        bearing reactions and the gear outputs. For simplicity, only the engine's maximum output power
                        specifications will be considered in the design.
                        Several specifications are given about the transfer box casing as a constraint for the design. The
                        maximum dimension is 4’’ x 10’’ x 13’’, with an input shaft parallel to two collinear output
                        shafts, being mountable from the bottom, and must be optimized to minimize space and
                        materials.

                        <strong>Abstract: </strong>
                        Most methods of cooling an object on Earth necessitate active cooling systems that
                        require the use of energy. Traditional cooling systems make up 17% of the world’s energy
                        demands [1]. Much of this energy is generated using fossil fuels, which in turn lead to rising
                        global temperatures. Furthermore, many common refrigerants are toxic to humans or harmful to
                        the environment. Radiative sky cooling presents an alternative to these harmful, power hungry
                        methods. Radiative cooling materials emit and reflect more heat than they absorb, allowing for
                        passive cooling. Ideally, the material should be a perfect reflector in the solar spectrum (0.5-2.5
                        μm) and have a thermal emission peak that aligns with the atmospheric transparency window
                        (8–13 μm) in the infrared. This allows the thermal radiation emitted from the surface to escape
                        into space, thus cooling the body. Such cooling effect becomes increasingly important due the
                        energy demand and overall increased heating, especially in urban areas. Increased energy
                        consumption is seen to raise overall ambient temperature, leading to a cyclical reliance.

                        Plane Form in the Design of Seed Airfoil for the use of Ecological Restoration </strong> </a> 
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Abstract: </strong>
                        This project looks to design a seed vehicle inspired by the Javan cucumber for seed dispersals for ecological 
                        restorations. A CFD analysis is used to determine the base coefficient of lift and drags under different flow 
                        conditions, angle of attacks. Such results from the initial analysis of the Javan Cucumber airfoil will be used 
                        to redesign the plane form, looking at the same aerodynamic properties to develop a more aerodynamics design. The 
                        redesign portion looks to optimize the lift-to-drag ratio and lift slopes as well as the maximum lift force and
                         minimum drag force through changing the aspect ratios.

                        <strong>Abstract: </strong> In this paper, various modification techniques to the steam turbine power plant will be explored
                        through their impact on efficiency, cost and other thermodynamic properties. The paper will start
                        off by analyzing the properties of the ideal Rankine cycle followed by the addition of a single
                        reheat, combined reheat and regeneration at various addition of feedwater heaters. The design of
                        these modified cycles will be based on these given design parameters: inlet pressure of 2000 psia,
                        power of 150,000 W and a steam quality of 87%. A cost analysis will be done on the additional
                        feedwater heaters into the design of the cycles. Note that in the analysis of various enthalpy and
                        specific entropy values within this paper, values calculated may not always be found in the
                        property tables. Such values are calculated using the simple interpolation MATLAB code using
                        values incapacitating the desired parameter.

                        <strong>Abstract: </strong>
                        In the proposal of the Dakota Access Pipeline, the uptick in opposition struck upon the need of an analysis 
                        of the overall impact of the pipeline to the environment and economy. In this analysis, to 
                        determine the more economic option to transport crude oil (at a rate of 91,000 m3/day), power consumption of an 
                        added pipeline vs the use of rail transportation is calculated to determine carbon emissions and costs to run. 
                        For the purpose of this analysis only the operations of the transportation's life cycle analysis are considered 
                        to simplify the comparation. Specific design requirements of the pipeline account for additions of valves and flanges 
                        added to overall head loss which is accounted for in the calculations</p>
